# Project Title
My DEX (Decentralized Exchange)

## Description
My DEX which is an insurance provider protocol.
Consisting of 2 main components:

- Crypto wallet insurance: You will have to build an insurance protocol that helps owners of smart contract wallets stay protected from hackers. The owners will be paying an insurance amount per month, set by the protocol. You can choose to invest the insurance amount in other DeFi schemes.
- Collateral protection for crypto backed loans: Based on the insurance policy the user has chosen, you can decide to give back the entire loan or % of the loan when the collateral value drops.

## Getting Started
